# Case Connections
Case Connections is a way to forge new connections, expand your Case network, learn something new, share knowledge, and have fun with your colleagues. Case Connections gives you 4 hours per year to have lunch/breakfast/coffee with someone outside your immediate project.

* Get outside your comfort zone
* Meeting new people will stimulate new ideas, relationships, and opportunities
* Invest in yourself!
