# Bonus Plans
Case has multiple bonus plans: a referral bonus, high fives, and spot bonuses.

## Referral Bonus - $5,000
* The referral bonus rewards employees for submitting high-quality candidates which existing employees feel comfortable personally vouching for.
* This is not intended to elicit unnecessary referrals, nor referrals for “unknown” candidates.  If submitting someone you cannot personally vouch for, state that in the referral so the appropriate interview can be scheduled for the referral.
* Candidates referred should be in the following Labor Categories (Software Engineer, Developer, Test Engineer, System Admin, DevOps, Application Architect, System Engineer, Project Manager, Systems Integrator, Scrum Master)
* All new referrals will be submitted via this Google Form to document the who is being referred, by whom, for what role, when, and to provide some initial comments on the candidate’s professional skills, suitability to join the company, and feedback on a prior experience working with them.
* A $2,500 bonus will be paid for uncleared candidates that we clear and later place on contract
