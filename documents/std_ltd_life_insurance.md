Each full-time employee is eligible for Short-term Disability (STD), Long Term Disability (LTD) and Life Insurance.  These plans also offer some Identity Theft protection as well as Travel Assistance.  See the attached documents for details on all plans.

STD is 70% of salary, up to $1500 per week for 13 weeks (Stars 1st day of accident or 8th day of sickness)
    Maternity coverage is:
        6 weeks (including the first 7 days elimination period) - which is 5 weeks paid for reg birth
        8 weeks (including the first 7 days elimination period) - which is 7 weeks paid for C-section
LTD is 60% of monthly salary, up to $7500
Life Insurance is equal to one year's salary

All policies start on the 1st of the month, however there is a 30 day waiting period before you can be added to the policy.  This means it is very likely that it will be longer than 30 days before your policy is effective.  For example, your first day at Case is 20 June then your policy effective date would be 1 August.
