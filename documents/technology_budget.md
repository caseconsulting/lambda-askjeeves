The technology benefit was created to allow employees to purchase a variety of technology items, for personal and professional use, in an effort to keep us on top of new technologies as they hit the market.  Whether it's a laptop to continue advancing  development skills or a new tablet, this benefit will help Case stay competitive and allow us to exploit new ideas from the commercial market in government spaces.  (The Apple lover can pick up an Android device they've been eyeing, just to learn about what's great (or not) about it. )

Employees may use some/all of this budget towards a donation to a charitable organization - 501(c)(3) or School of their choosing. This is a great way to put any remaining balances after your technology purchases to good use! Please follow the guidelines below for reimbursement for this type expense. Remember to get a receipt! Additional information is here.

Technology Budgets can also be used to increase your Training budget
